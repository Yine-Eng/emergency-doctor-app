## 🧭 Goals & Vision

We aim to make **lifesaving care more accessible**, especially for vulnerable groups, travelers, and individuals who may not have immediate access to healthcare. This app is inspired by real-world emergency gaps and seeks to:

- Improve emergency communication
- Offer real-time, **device-native support**
- Educate users while respecting privacy and cost

## ❓ Questions This App Answers

- "What first aid should I apply before help arrives?"
- "How can I quickly notify someone I'm in danger?"
- "What if I can't speak but need to alert someone?"
- "How can emergency responders know my condition from my lock screen?"

## 🛡️ Considerations & Philosophy

- All user inputs are treated as **potentially malicious**
- Authentication errors are **non-descriptive** to prevent info leakage
- App performance is optimized for **low-end devices**
- **Free forever** — no ads, no subscriptions (planned)
